# Assignments from CS1B - Intro to Comp Sci II
Assignments demonstrate knowledge of the following subjects in C++:
- Arithmetic
- Standard input and output
- Matrices
- File input streams
- Dynamic, automatic, and static memory allocation and management
- Debugging tools such as valgrind and gdb
- GCC, Makefiles and make
- Linked list ADTs
- Operator overloading
- Object-orientation and related concepts (encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance)
- Vectors / Standard Template Library

Note that each assignment had various requirements and instructions that unfortunately are no longer available, as a result many assignments may appear to be implemented in an otherwise strange way (i.e. repeated statements as opposed to loops/arrays, methods separated to individual files, etc).
